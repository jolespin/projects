#### Summary
Host-associated microbial communities are influ- enced by both host genetics and environmental fac- tors. However, factors controlling the human oral microbiome and their impact on disease remain to be investigated. To determine the combined and relative effects of host genotype and environment on oral microbiome composition and caries pheno- types, we profiled the supragingival plaque micro- biome of 485 dizygotic and monozygotic twins aged 5–11. Oral microbiome similarity always increased with shared host genotype, regardless of caries state. Additionally, although most of the varia- tion in the oral microbiome was determined by envi- ronmental factors, highly heritable oral taxa were identified. The most heritable oral bacteria were not associated with caries state, did not tend to co-occur with other taxa, and decreased in abundance with age and sugar consumption frequency. Thus, while the human oral microbiome composition is influ- enced by host genetic background, potentially cario- genic taxa are likely not controlled by genetic factors.
